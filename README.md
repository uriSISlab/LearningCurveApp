# Learning 'Learning Curves' with R Shiny

Within this repository, two independent Shiny apps are presented to assist with teaching and learning about learning curves. 

The Demonstrational version of the app can be run independently and provides a short example of what learning curves look like and also supports interaction from students.

The Assignment version of the app is intended for students to use independently. Students build three LEGO&reg; items from a set sixteen times and enter their data into the app. The app then generates plots and equations for each LEGO&reg; item. Within this app, the user can generate a report which creates an html file including all data, plots, and equations. The AssignmentReport.rmd file and the LearningCurveAssignmentApp.R must be stored in the same folder.

The LearningCurveGuidedCode.rmd provides a template for users to interact with code directly to perform a similar set of functions as the Shiny app does behind the scenes.
